# DAG
- Implemented a set of algorithms for directed acyclic graph (DAG) with matrix representation in C for
representing programming code.
- Wrote a function for discovering an optimal order of operations in a code and its duration.
- Designed and wrote a command-line menu for interactive use of the mentioned algorithms.
